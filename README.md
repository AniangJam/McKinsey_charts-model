I made 2 McKinsey visuals in Excel. McKinsey & Company is the most prestigious consulting firm in the world, so they're known to make some of the best visuals in the industry. Thatâ€™s why I wanted to replicate 2 of their most popular visuals, in Excel.  First, i made a bar chart to compare one column of numbers inside of the other. This is similar to a budget vs actuals chart. Lastly, i made a stacked bar chart to showcase the demographics in each step of the corporate ladder. 
You can download the excel file with the data used and the visuals.
